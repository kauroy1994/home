I was invited to be a part of a [panel discussion themed “Shaping the Future”](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7140847438138970112/) focused on AI and its impact in higher education and the world of work. This was part of Symposium held at the [2023 Artificial Intelligence Symposium](https://www.goscace.org/event-5388014), hosted by [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/index.html). It was a great honor to share the stage with panelists from highly reputed corporations, such as [Milliken](https://www.milliken.com/en-us).
