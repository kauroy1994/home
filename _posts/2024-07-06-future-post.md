I had the opportunity to discuss my research with the University of South Carolina's news team, and I'm excited about the coverage our project received. As a doctoral student in computer science at the College of Engineering and Computing, I've had the pleasure of working on a project topic that's very close to my heart - using artificial intelligence to improve telehealth services, particularly in mental health care.

My personal experiences with healthcare access issues have driven me to collaborate with an incredible team of experts from across our university and beyond. We're developing a virtual health assistant that can monitor patients' mental health between clinical visits, which has become even more crucial due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our AI-powered tool analyzes millions of interactions from public health forums to create algorithms that can keep clinicians informed about their patients' conditions. I believe this technology has enormous potential to assist healthcare providers and improve care accessibility. While we're still in the development stages, with funding proposals pending, I'm hopeful that we'll soon move to clinical trials and ultimately make a significant impact on mental health care delivery.
