permalink: /publication/2024-02-17-paper-title-number-4
excerpt: 'The rapid progression of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, facilitated by the advent of large language models (LLMs), has resulted in their widespread application to provide human assistance across diverse industries. This trend has sparked significant discourse centered around the ever-increasing need for LLM-based AI systems to function among humans as a part of human society. Toward this end, neurosymbolic AI systems are attractive because of their potential to enable and interpretable interfaces for facilitating value-based decision making by leveraging explicit representations of shared values. In this article, we introduce substantial extensions to Kahneman’s System 1 and System 2 framework and propose a neurosymbolic computational framework called value-inspired AI (VAI). It outlines the crucial components essential for the robust and practical implementation of VAI systems, representing and integrating various dimensions of human values. Finally, we further offer insights into the current progress made in this direction and outline potential future directions for the field.'

The rapid progression of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, facilitated by the advent of large language models (LLMs), has resulted in their widespread application to provide human assistance across diverse industries. This trend has sparked significant discourse centered around the ever-increasing need for LLM-based AI systems to function among humans as a part of human society. Toward this end, neurosymbolic AI systems are attractive because of their potential to enable and interpretable interfaces for facilitating value-based decision making by leveraging explicit representations of shared values. In this article, we introduce substantial extensions to Kahneman’s System 1 and System 2 framework and propose a neurosymbolic computational framework called value-inspired AI (VAI).
