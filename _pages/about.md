I am Kaushik Roy, a Ph.D. candidate at the <img src="https://github.com/kauroy1994/home/assets/57400980/b46cee36-a77f-4aa3-af07-cdbea1833a95" width="20" height="20"> [Artificial Intelligence Institute, University of South Carolina](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aiisc/mycompany/). My research focuses on developing neurosymbolic methods for declarative and process knowledge-infused learning, reasoning, and sequential decision-making, with a particular emphasis on social good applications. Currently, I work as an Artificial Intelligence Researcher Intern at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI), where I'm building cognitive architecture-inspired neurosymbolic AI systems for egocentric activity recognition. My academic journey has taken me from R.V. College of Engineering in Bangalore for my Bachelor's to Indiana University Bloomington for my Master's, and briefly to the University of Texas at Dallas before settling at the University of South Carolina for my doctoral studies. My research interests span machine learning, artificial intelligence, and their application in social good settings. I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI, particularly in areas where it intersects with human understanding and decision-making.
