I am Kaushik Roy, an Assistant Professor at the [University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa](https://eng.ua.edu/eng-directory/dr-kaushik-roy/). My research focuses on developing neurosymbolic methods for declarative and process knowledge-infused learning, reasoning, and sequential decision-making, with a particular emphasis on social good applications. My academic journey has taken me from R.V. College of Engineering in Bangalore for my Bachelor's to Indiana University Bloomington for my Master's, and briefly to the University of Texas at Dallas before graduating from the University of South Carolina with my PhD. My research interests span machine learning, artificial intelligence, and their application in social good settings. I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI, particularly in areas where it intersects with human understanding and decision-making.
